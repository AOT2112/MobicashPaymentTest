    "Question": "How safe is the %SUBST_APPLICATION_NAME% service?",
    "Answer": "%SUBST_APPLICATION_NAME% is extremely secure and has been designed with your security in mind. We have a number of security measures in place. These include:\n\nPIN protection. Just like your card and your mobile phone, the app is protected with a four-digit PIN.\n\nPIN block. If you have forgotten your PIN you are given three attempts to remember it. If you are still unsuccessful after a 30-minute delay you will be given another three attempts to enter the correct PIN. After this you will be referred to the customer services team so that we can verify that you are you.\n\nSecurity questions. If you have set up the security questions and answers (tap on the icon on the righthand corner of the screen and choose the Security questions option), this feature will be offered to you after the first unsuccessful PIN attempt or will automatically kick in after three unsuccessful PIN attempts. If the first security question is answered incorrectly, you will be asked two more questions. If either of these is answered incorrectly, your account will be temporarily blocked until we can verify that you are you.\n\nBiometrics. You can use biometric authentication instead of your PIN. Biometric authentication is available for devices that are equipped with the appropriate scanner.\n\nAutomatic logout. This app is designed to automatically log you out after a few minutes of inactivity. For your own peace of mind, you can adjust this timeframe as you see fit.\n\nUnique identifiers. Both your mobile device and mobile number are linked to your %SUBST_APPLICATION_NAME% account and act as unique identifiers. This is to ensure that a fraudster cannot access your account from any other device or using a different mobile number (SIM card).\n\nMemPad. MemPad is an easy way to enter your PIN and boasts a non-standard keyboard, making it hard for fraudsters to gain access to your PIN using hacking software to capture keyboard entries.\n\nCard details secure storage. For security reasons your card numbers are not stored on your mobile device. Your details will be stored on a secure server in our certified (worldwide Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard compliant) data centre.\n\nRetailers / billers / businesses do not see your financial details. No financial information is passed on to retailers / billers / businesses when you make payments with this app.\n\n3D Secure. This service uses 3D Secure. 3D Secure (Verified by VISA, MasterCard SecureCode) is an extra layer of security offered to you by your bank when shopping. Each bank has its own 3D Secure verification procedure. When making a payment you will need to follow your bank procedure."

    "Question": "I lost my mobile device what should I do?",
    "Answer": "For security reasons your payment method details are not stored on your mobile device and the app is password protected should it fall into the wrong hands. Once you have recovered or replaced your mobile phone, download the app and activate your account."

    "Question": "What should I do if I suspect unauthorised activity on my %SUBST_APPLICATION_NAME% account?",
    "Answer": "This situation is highly unlikely as your %SUBST_APPLICATION_NAME% account is linked to your device and phone number (SIM card). Unlike cards or online shopping accounts, your %SUBST_APPLICATION_NAME% account cannot be used without your knowledge on another device.\n\nIf you still think someone has accessed your account by using your phone without your permission you need to report this activity immediately. There are several options available to you. If you can, sign in to your %SUBST_APPLICATION_NAME% account and change your PIN. Alternatively, you can request a callback or remove your payment methods at any time by either tapping on the Wallet icon on the Dashboard screen and choosing the delete option or tapping on the icon on the righthand corner of the screen and choosing the Remove all payment methods option.\nOnce the situation has been resolved, you can add a payment method to your account and begin using the service again."

    "Question": "What do I do if my account has been blocked / suspended?",
    "Answer": "Your security is our top priority. If we believe that your account might be at risk, we may block it for security reasons. Your account will only be blocked if certain suspicious actions are performed in your app (for example, there were three incorrect attempts to enter your PIN).\n\nYou will be notified that your account is blocked / suspended via the app and you will be offered an option to request a callback from a customer service representative. You will also have an option to cancel the process and address the situation at your convenience. In this case, the app will redirect you to the Welcome screen. You will need to press Subscribe / Sign in, enter your phone number and request a callback. When your account is blocked, we will have to speak to you in person so that we will be able to establish that you are you and it is safe to reactivate your account.\n\nWe cannot send you an automated reactivation link via email, as some other services choose to do. This is due to the fact that should a fraudster get hold of your phone, they might be able to get access your email and use the link to gain access to your %SUBST_APPLICATION_NAME% account. If we speak to you in person, we can ensure your account will always be safe and secure."

    "Question": "What is the difference between Subscribe, Activate and Guest Mode?",
    "Answer": "To get the most benefit from this service and all of the associated advantages, we recommend that you subscribe. Subscribing means that you will have a full %SUBST_APPLICATION_NAME% account. Should you choose not to subscribe, there is also a guest checkout option, which lets you pay but only offers the basic features of the %SUBST_APPLICATION_NAME% service.\n\nThe activate option is available to customers that already have a %SUBST_APPLICATION_NAME% account. This is for when, for example, you are reinstalling the app on a new handset or your account has been deactivated / suspended for security reasons."

Standard charges set up between you and your bank/card issuer will still apply. Network charges as agreed with your mobile network provider to include data usage may also apply. All text messages that you receive from %SUBST_APPLICATION_NAME% are free unless abroad or roaming.\n\nTo ensure your transactions are secure when using %SUBST_APPLICATION_NAME%, you will need to go through the 3D Secure process as set up by your card issuer. As part of the registration process your card issuer may inform you that your account will be debited one unit of the currency in the account.
